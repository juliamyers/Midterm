CSC 174 Midterm Project


Ontology
  - the most important parts of this site is the bike icon because it serves as the link back to the home page as well as the center text on the home page since it tells you what the site is about. Also, the email sign up form is important so that people can get more information about the site and travelling to Copenhagen.  The headers and info in the second page are also very important because it shows the user the great things they can see in Copenhagen and persuades them to visit.
  
Taxonomy
  - Headers are larger and a different font from the rest of the text to show their imporance, grab the attention of the user, and show what the page/section is about.
  - "Tourist Reviews" title was added to the unordered lists on the second page so that the user knows what the list contains 
  - the headers in the black backgrounda are all white so they are readable
  - i made the descriptions of the tourist attractions about the same length to help with flow and readability of the site contents.
  
  
Choreography
  - on the home page, the main topic of the site is put in the middle of the hero image so that the user immediately knows what the site is about
  - the rest of the contents in the home page are oranized in a Z-pattern so that the users eyes are moved through all of the important aspects of the site and will move on to the next page
  - the bike icon and heading are presented first on the second page because they are most important - the bike icon serves as the link back to the home oage and the heading shows what the page is about which is also important to know.
  - the rest of the content on the page is organized into an F-pattern so that the users eyes are taken over to the right and then down the page and will see all of the important things about the various tourist attractions.


Gutenberg Rules: 

Z-format:
  - eye starts in the primary area (top left corner) where the bike icon is. I placed this in the top left because it is the icon of copenhagen and serves as the link back to the home page which is very important.
  - eye then goes to the strong follow section (top right) where the email subscription sign up is.  I put that there because it is important to the site since I want people to sign up for the newsletter but it is not necessary.
  - eyes then travel across the hero image to the weak section (bottom left).  The "Explore the Biking City" footer is here because it is relevant info since Copenhagen is called "The biking City" but it is not the most important for the user to know.
  - finally, eyes move across to the terminal section (bottom right). I put the button with the link to the next page there because it is the "next action" which is very important.

F-format:
  - eye starts on the top left side where the bike icon is again. it was important to put that there because it is the link back to the home page. I also put the headers and pictures of the site on the right because that is the area with the most eye traffic and those are the most important parts of the page.  I think it is most important for the user to know the name of the place and what it looks like so they can decide if they want to visit it.
  - the title "What You Can See in Copenhagen" is also in the top left because it tells you what the page is about which is very important - so its towards the left because that gets alot of eye traffic.
  - the description of the place is then to the right which brings the users eye across the page. I put the description next because it is important for the user to know about the place to decide if they want to go but I think it is less helpful than the picture and name of it.
  - I then put reviews about the locations on the far right.  This pulls the viewers eyes further across the page in accordance to the F-pattern.  I put this on the far right because people will want to read the reviews so they will look that far across the page, but it isnt that important since it is just peoples' opinions.
  - I repeated this pattern down the page for each tourist attraction to creat the "F" format
  - finally the footer on the bottom brings the eye down creating the bottom of the "F". I put this here because it is the least important aspect of the page and that section of the page does not get much eye traffic.


C.R.A.P Pricipals:

Contrast
  - I put a slightly transparent background on the header, footer, and middle text of the home page so that the suer could read the words. I wanted the picture of Copemhagen to be the background because it shows how beautiful the country is and persuades people to visit, but it made it difficult to read the text so I added the transparent backgrounds to increase readability.
  - I added a hover detail on the "Read More" button so that it changes to blue when your mouse hovers over it and signifies that it is a link to the next page.
  - I put a box around the reviews on the second page to distinguish it from the other text that is next to it and increase readability for the user.
  - I also used 2 fonts to add contrast between the headers and the paragraph text. I did this to draw the eye to the headers and emphasize their importance to the user.  I chose two fonts that were listed as complimentary on Google Fonts.  I chose that pair because they have a professional/polished vibe which matches the content of the website since it is about Copenhagen which is a very modern and polishde city.
  
Repitition
  - I used the same bike picture on both pages so that the user knows to click that to get back to the home page
  - I used the same footer on both pages to emphasize that the nickname for Copenhagen is "the biking city" and to connect it to the bike icon in the header
  - i used a grey scale color scheme throughout the website because I didnt want it to take away from the hero image which is very beautiful and colorful as well as the other images on the second page.  I wanted the images to stand out on the pages.

Alignment
  - I used the Z-pattern formatting provided to use to align the parts of the home page into a Z-form. This was done because the Z-pattern is a gret way to organize a page as it brings the users eyes to the most important parts.
  - I also aligned the contents on the second page in horizontal rows in order to make it into an F-pattern and to make sure that the most important parts of the website (the names and pictures of the toursit attractions) were in the areas with the most eye traffic (left side) followed by the secon most important part (the descriptions), and finally the reviews. I worked hard to have these all align properly so that the page looked polished and readable for the user.
  - I ensured that the second page was aligned in the center of the screen and did not stretch all the way to the borders of the screen. I did this to make sure that the content was readable for the user

Proximity
  - I put the info about the various tourist attractions closely next to each other so that the user would know which picture/desccription/review went with which attraction.
