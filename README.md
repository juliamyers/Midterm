Z-format:
  - eye starts in the primary area (top left corner) where the bike icon is. I placed this in the top left because it is the icon of copenhagen and serves as the link back to the home page which is very important.
  - eye then goes to the strong follow section (top right) where the email subscription sign up is.  I put that there because it is important to the site since I want people to sign up for the newsletter but it is not necessary.
  - eyes then travel across the hero image to the weak section (bottom left).  The "Explore the Biking City" footer is here because it is relevant info since Copenhagen is called "The biking City" but it is not the most important for the user to know.
  - finally, eyes move across to the terminal section (bottom right). I put the button with the link to the next page there because it is the "next action" which is very important.

F-format:
  - eye starts on the top left side where the bike icon is again. it was important to put that there because it is the link back to the home page. I also put the headers and pictures of the site on the right because that is the area with the most eye traffic and those are the most important parts of the page.  I think it is most important for the user to know the name of the place and what it looks like so they can decide if they want to visit it.
  - the title "Team Alicante" is also in the top left because it is the link back to the index page which is very important
  - the picture of the student is then to the right which brings the users eye across the page. I put the picture next because it is good for the user to be able to put a face to a name but it is secondary to actually reading about them
  - the button that links to their personal pages is on the far right.  This drags the users eyes further across the page but is the least important aspect so i put it on the far right. It is important to provide the link but I want users to stay on our site so I didnt want to put an external link in a more important area.
  - i repeated this pattern down the page to creat the "F" format
  - finally the footer on the bottom brings the eye down creating the bottom of the "F". I put this here because it is the least important aspect of the page and that section of the page does not get much eye traffic.
